# GOOGLE-DATA-ANALYTICS-CAPESTONE-PROJECT
This is part of the Data Analytics certification program from Google.   
My name is Kola Ademola and I'll be taking on this project to showcase what I have learnt so far from the program and  
also add this project to my personal portfolio.  
I'm still learning and open to corrections as this may not be a perfect approach or analysis.  
I will be using the Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act approach. Thank you all!!!
